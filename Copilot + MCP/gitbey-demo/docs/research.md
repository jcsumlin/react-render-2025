# GitBey App: Market Research Analysis

## Executive Summary

GitBey is a mobile app concept that analyzes a user's GitHub commit history to recommend personalized Beyoncé songs based on the "vibe" of their last 50 commits. This research explores the market potential, technical feasibility, and business opportunities for this unique intersection of developer tools and music entertainment.

## App Concept

**GitBey** takes a user's GitHub handle and returns 5 Beyoncé songs based on the sentiment and patterns of their recent commit activity. Users can play these songs directly in the app, creating a personalized soundtrack to their coding journey.
